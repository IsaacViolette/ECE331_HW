		alias grep="grep -E"
	b.
		Open a new file called .bash_aliases (Command: vim .bash_aliases).
		In the file, write this line: alias grep="grep -E" and save it.
		Since the .bashrc file checks for .bash_aliases, all aliases can be written in the 
		new file.
		Now that the alias is set, .bashrc needs to be sourced using the command: source 
		.bashrc .
