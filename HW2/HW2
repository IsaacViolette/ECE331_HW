	grep -r 'for ('[a-zA-Z][^n][^t] /usr/src/linux/kernel/

	This command returned a list that proved that "most" of the linux kernel code
	declares iterators at the start of a function. Now this is the 
	"cleanest" grep I could seem to make, but there is a possibility that leaving 
	out the 'n' and 't' could in turn get rid of some needed results. I also tried 
	the following command to check if the variable iterators were included in the 
	for-loop statement locally:
	grep -r 'for (int' /usr/src/linux/kernel/
	This ended up returning a few results which made it seem as though the kernel
	"mostly" uses iterator variables declared at the start of a function.
